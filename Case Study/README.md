## High Level Requirement
*  
* Display: It should disply the measured temperature on display.
* Accuracy: Accuracy should be high.
* 
* 
## Low Level Requirement
* buzzer
* push switch
* led power light
* 

## Digital Thermometer components:
* Battery: It is to provide the supply to the thermometer.

* Body: The body of the thermometer is made up of hard plastic.

* Thermister: It is a semiconductor material made up of ceramic and is used to sense the temperature. It is placed at the 
  tip of the thermometer by binding with epoxy and is enclosed inside a cap made up of stainless steel.

* LCD: It is the display of the thermometer.It displays the reading for the
  temperature to be measured.

* Circuit: It consists of an ADC and a microcontroller along with some passive components.


## Advantages of Digital Thermometers:
* Accuracy: The temperature reading doesn’t depend on scale reading and instead shown directly on the display.Hence     
  temperature can be read exactly and accurately.

* Speed: Digital thermometers can reach a final temperature in 5 to 10 seconds compared to conventional thermometers.

* Safety: Digital thermometers don’t use mercury, hence the hazards of the mercury is eliminated in case the thermometer 
  breaks.

* Strong: The thermometer doesn’t need to be shaken for the proper mercury level, hence the risk of the tube getting 
  broken is eliminated.

## Applications of Digital Thermometer:
* Medical Applications: The digital thermometers are used to measure human body temperature around 37⁰C. These 
  thermometers are mostly probe type or ear type. It measures oral and armpit body temperature.

* Marine Applications: Digital thermometers with a high-temperature exhaust gas sensor as the temperature sensor can be   
  used in marine applications for measuring the local temperature.

* Industrial Applications: Digital thermometers are also used in power plants, nuclear power plants, blast furnaces, 
  shipbuilding industries, etc. They can measure temperature from -220⁰C to +850⁰C.

* HVAC thermometers — rated for HVAC applications such as duct or flume monitoring.

* Sanitary applications — Sanitary thermometers are rated for sanitary use such as food or pharmaceutical applications.

* Home use — includes digital thermometers used for home health care, cooking, and monitoring temperature on home 
  appliances such as the refrigerator or swimming pool.

* Laboratory — includes monitoring experiments and chemical reactions as well as maintaining an optimal laboratory 
  environment.

* Food Service — uses thermometers in identifying completeness of cooking, and sanitation of ingredients.

* Meteorological thermometers — give air, atmosphere and water temperature readings.
