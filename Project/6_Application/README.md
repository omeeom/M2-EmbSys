## Applications of Digital Thermometer:
* Medical Applications: The digital thermometers are used to measure human body 
  temperature around 37⁰C. These 
  thermometers are mostly probe type or ear type. It measures oral and armpit body temperature.

* Marine Applications: Digital thermometers with a high-temperature exhaust gas 
  sensor as the temperature sensor can be   
  used in marine applications for measuring the local temperature.

* Industrial Applications: Digital thermometers are also used in power plants, 
  nuclear power plants, blast furnaces, 
  shipbuilding industries, etc. They can measure temperature from -220⁰C to +850⁰C.

* HVAC thermometers — rated for HVAC applications such as duct or flume 
  monitoring.

* Sanitary applications — Sanitary thermometers are rated for sanitary use such '
  as food or pharmaceutical applications.

* Home use — includes digital thermometers used for home health care, cooking, 
  and monitoring temperature on home 
  appliances such as the refrigerator or swimming pool.

* Laboratory — includes monitoring experiments and chemical reactions as well as 
  maintaining an optimal laboratory 
  environment.

* Food Service — uses thermometers in identifying completeness of cooking, and 
  sanitation of ingredients.

* Meteorological thermometers — give air, atmosphere and water temperature 
  readings.


## Advantages of Digital Thermometers:
* Accuracy: The temperature reading doesn’t depend on scale reading and instead 
  shown directly on the display.Hence     
  temperature can be read exactly and accurately.

* Speed: Digital thermometers can reach a final temperature in 5 to 10 seconds 
  compared to conventional thermometers.

* Safety: Digital thermometers don’t use mercury, hence the hazards of the 
  mercury is eliminated in case the thermometer 
  breaks.

* Strong: The thermometer doesn’t need to be shaken for the proper mercury level, hence the risk of the tube getting 
  broken is eliminated.
