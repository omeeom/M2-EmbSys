## Digital Thermometer components:
* `Battery`: It is to provide the supply to the thermometer.

* `LCD (16x2)`: LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is widely used electronic display  
  module and got a wide range of applications. 
  A 16×2 LCD consists of 16 columns and 2 rows thereby it is capable of displaying 16 characters in a single line. 
  It consists of two registers, Command register used to store the command instructions given to the LCD.

* `LM35`: The LM35 is an integrated circuit sensor that can be used to measure temperature. 
  It is a precision IC temperature sensor with its output proportional to the temperature (in oC). 
  The sensor circuitry is sealed and therefore it is not subjected to oxidation and other processes.
  With  LM35,  temperature  can be  measured  more  accurately  than  with  a thermistor. 
  It  also  possess  low  self-heating  and  does  not  cause  more  than  0.1 deg C temperature rise in still air. 
  The operating temperature range is from -55°C to 150°C. 
  The output voltage varies by 10mV in response to every oC rise/fall in ambient temperature, i.e., its scale factor is 0.01V/ oC. 

* `AVR Microcontroller`:The full form of AVR is Alf-Egil Bogen Vegard Wollan RISC 
  microcontroller. It’s used on Computing,Hardware in Worldwide. 
  The AVR is a 8-bit RISC single chip microcontroller developed by Atmel. 

* `Circuit`: It consists of an ADC and a microcontroller along with some passive 
  components.
